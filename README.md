## 📌 Description
Many SMEs rely heavily on Google Calendar to schedule meetings, deadlines, and events. However, organizing and analyzing this information can be challenging, especially when it needs to be consolidated for reporting, project management, or sharing across teams. Manually transferring data from Google Calendar to a more accessible format like Google Sheets is time-consuming and prone to errors. This inefficiency can lead to miscommunication, missed deadlines, and reduced productivity.


## ✨ Features

- **Feature 2**: Real-Time Sync: Any updates or changes made in Google Calendar are reflected in Google Sheets upon the next click, ensuring the data remains current and accurate.
- **Feature 3**: User-Friendly Interface: The setup is simple, requiring minimal technical expertise, and the button can be easily integrated into existing workflows
- **Feature 4**: Scalability: This solution is designed to scale with your business, capable of handling increasing volumes of data without compromising performance.
